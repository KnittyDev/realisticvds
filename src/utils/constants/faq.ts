        question: "How does this process work?",
        answer: "When you pay, you are given an order number. For example: #43510059 , we receive your order information and payment. If your order is a prepaid physical card, it is processed differently. If it is digital, it goes through a different process. We clone your prepaid physical cards according to the limit you want in the order without fingerprints on it, we add a number of extra measures to your card, so we get a card that does not hold 100% of your past payments. In this way, you can use your card anywhere you want. You can make contactless payments, you can define your Google Pay and Apple Pay accounts, you can even use your card on your phone with the NFC feature. 3D Secure feature is deactive on all cards. Afterwards, we first give your card to the international cargo company and then to your local cargo company. This is 100% safe because we package your card just like it comes from a bank, as if you ordered a new credit card from the bank. In this process, we share some details such as cargo tracking number, order number, how many days it will arrive. You can track all these details with your 8-digit order number on the “Track Order” page. As for the digital card, our transactions are made with 100% proxy security, we encrypt your digital expenses and ATM withdrawal requests with a digital card. We guarantee that we will provide you with the necessary support 24/7  It works 100% on all global websites such as Amazon, BestBuy, Ebay, Walmart, Shopify and local websites in your country, your digital product orders are shipped within 5 to 30 minutes. You can check your order 24/7 from the “Track Order” page.",

        question: "How can I order?",
        answer: "First of all, create an account on websites like Binance, Coinbase, BitPay. Having a personal account does not create anonymity problems because the wallet code you will use to buy our product is single-use, this wallet code will destroy and delete itself after transferring the money. Then, enter our website, select the product and package you want, fill in the necessary contact information. Copy the wallet code specified in the description and send the required amount to the wallet specified on the payment screen. And your order is complete! You can actively track your order with your 8-digit order code!",

        question: "Whats my order ID?",
        answer: "Your order ID is an 8-digit order id that allows you to track your order and track its status. Ex: #43510042 Your order id is written on the order payment screen and on the screen if the payment is successful. You can copy your order id after successful payment and order your order from the “track order” section. But don't worry, we will send all payment information to your e-mail address, if you have a problem you can chat with us.",

        question: "Why don't you spend all the money yourself?",
        answer: "Its a logical question, how much money can you launder in one country? There is a limit, if we spend all the money for ourselves or try to launder it, it would be a big security problem, our team is 12 people and our whole team lives in 4 different countries and we still cant launder this money. The only way to launder the money and spend it for ourselves is to distribute it indirectly. We did it on Twitch by sending bits but it didnt work very well, the most reliable way was to create this website for us. That way we keep our customers happy and we get our fair share. The customer is happy and safe and we are happy and safe and I think its a fair offer. Because no one will follow the 5000-10000 dollars you spend, its a very small amount of money. So you can try us and experience our products yourself.",
